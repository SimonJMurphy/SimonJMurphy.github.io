## Simon J. Murphy, University of Sydney

Simon Murphy is a postdoctoral researcher in asteroseismology at the University of Sydney. He uses stellar pulsations to characterise stellar masses, ages and metallicities. His research focusses on pulsating A/F stars, particularly delta Scuti stars, and stellar chemically peculiarities such as the lambda Bootis phenomenon. He also uses pulsation timing to find and parametrise binary systems.

Simon is also an outdoors enthusiast, participating in many adventure sports and activites.
