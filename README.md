# Simon J. Murphy, Univ. of Southern Queensland

Simon Murphy is an ARC Future Fellow in asteroseismology at the University of Southern Queensland. He uses stellar pulsations to characterise stellar masses, ages and metallicities. His research focusses on pulsating A/F stars, particularly delta Scuti stars, and stellar chemical peculiarities such as the &lambda; Bootis phenomenon. He also uses pulsation timing to find and parametrise binary systems. \[[contact](https://simonjmurphy.github.io/#contact)\]

Simon is also an outdoors enthusiast, participating in many adventure sports and activites.

## Research interests

_I'm currently working on:_  
Mode identification for rapidly rotating pulsators in the Pleiades star cluster. This will help us to derive accurate cluster ages from asteroseismology!

My interests:
   * stellar evolution
   * pre-main-sequence stars
   * asteroseismic parameter inference
   * pulsation timing
   * binary star orbits
   * &delta; Scuti stars
   * &lambda; Bootis stars
   * &gamma; Doradus variables
   * roAp stars
   * Am/Ap stars
