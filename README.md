# Simon J. Murphy, USQ

[=> opening: PhD position with scholarship](https://simonjmurphy.github.io/#phd-position)

Simon Murphy is an ARC Future Fellow in asteroseismology at the University of Southern Queensland (USQ). He uses stellar pulsations to characterise stellar masses, ages and metallicities. His research focusses on pulsating A/F stars, particularly delta Scuti stars, and stellar chemical peculiarities such as the &lambda; Bootis phenomenon. He also uses pulsation timing to find and parametrise binary systems. \[[contact](https://simonjmurphy.github.io/#contact)\]

Simon is also an outdoors enthusiast, participating in many adventure sports and activites.

## Research interests

_I'm currently working on:_  
Mode identification for rapidly rotating pulsators in the Pleiades star cluster. This will help us to derive accurate cluster ages from asteroseismology!

My interests:
   * stellar evolution
   * pre-main-sequence stars
   * asteroseismic parameter inference
   * pulsation timing
   * binary star orbits
   * &delta; Scuti stars
   * &lambda; Bootis stars
   * &gamma; Doradus variables
   * roAp stars
   * Am/Ap stars

## PhD Position

_I have an opening for a PhD student to start late 2022 / early 2023. The advert text is below. Reach out with any queries!_

The Centre for Astrophysics at the University of Southern Queensland is seeking applications for a fully-funded scholarship PhD position, to begin between 2022 November and 2023 February (flexible).  The stipend totals $32,000 AUD per year for 3 years, plus an allowance for computing and travel.  Details on the research interests in our Centre can be found at [https://astrophysics.usq.edu.au/](https://astrophysics.usq.edu.au/)

Australia’s University of Southern Queensland is a [top-100 Young University Rankings](https://www.unisq.edu.au/news/2022/02/times-higher-education-ranking) multi-campus institution whose flagship [top rated astronomical and space sciences research](https://dataportal.arc.gov.au/era/web/outcomes#/institution/USQ) is supported by a dedicated [Centre for Astrophysics](https://www.unisq.edu.au/research/institutes-centres/iaess/centre-for-astrophysics) within the [Institute for Advanced Engineering and Space Sciences](https://www.unisq.edu.au/research/institutes-centres/iaess).

For this special call, the position is funded by UniSQ through start-up funds associated with [Dr. Simon Murphy](https://astrophysics.usq.edu.au/simon-j-murphy/)’s Future Fellowship from the Australian Research Council. 

The student will be expected to work on modelling the pulsations of intermediate-mass stars. The role will be focussed around data analysis and computational experimental design in an astrophysical context. There will also be opportunities to plan and analyse astrophysical observations.

Interested candidates should send a CV and contact details for one reference to Dr Simon Murphy (<simon.murphy@usq.edu.au>) by August 24th for full consideration.  UniSQ is committed to enhancing diversity in astrophysics, and we particularly welcome applications from women and traditionally under-represented groups.

Enquiries about the research in the Centre for Astrophysics can be directed to <simon.murphy@usq.edu.au>
